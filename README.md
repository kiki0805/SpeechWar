# Speech War
Speech War: A multiplayer game played through speech

## CODING
### Coding style
* CamelCase for variables, functions and methods
* ALLCAPS for tokens and constants
* Classes, functions and methods start with uppercase (e.g. MoveUp)
* Variables start with lowercase (e.g. playerList)
* Blocks are wrapped with curly brackets on individual lines

### Commenting style
* All classes, functions and methods should be commented and include:
  * What it does
  * Parameters
  * Return value
* Try to keep the code self-explanatory by having relevant variable/function/etc. names

## WORK FLOW
* Please remember to document any issues and give it the appropriate label
* Don't forget to close issues if they are solved
